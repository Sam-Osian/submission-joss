    abstract = {In England and Wales, coroners are required to write Prevention of Future Deaths reports when a death is deemed preventable so that action is taken to avert similar deaths. Since July 2013, Prevention of Future Deaths reports have been openly available via the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website (https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/). However, their presentation to date have been insufficient to identify trends and learn lessons. We designed a web scraper to create the Preventable Deaths Tracker (https://preventabledeathstracker.net/). On 22 June 2022, 4001 PFDs were scraped, analysed, and compared to the Office of National Statistics’ preventable mortality statistics. This commentary summarises the key findings and offers recommendations to improve the Prevention of Future Deaths system so lessons can be learnt to avert preventable deaths.},

    abstract = {Background: Over 5000 suicides are registered in England and Wales each year. Coroners’ Prevention of Future Deaths reports (PFDs) share concerns to promote actions to reduce the risks of similar deaths. Aims: To systematically review coroners’ PFDs involving suicides in which a medicine caused or contributed to the death, to identify lessons for suicide prevention.
Methods: 3037 PFDs were screened for eligibility between July 2013 and December 2019. Following data extraction, descriptive statistics and content analysis were performed to assess coroners’ concerns, the recipients, and the response rates to reports.
Results: There were 734 suicide-related PFDs, with 100 reporting a medicine. Opioids (40\%) were the most common class involved in suicide-related PFDs, followed by antidepressants (30\%). There was wide geographical variation in the writing of PFDs; coroners in Manchester wrote the most (18\%). Coroners expressed 237 concerns; the most common were procedural inadequacies (14\%, n=32), inadequate documentation and communication (10\%, n=22), and inappropriate prescription access (9\%, n=21). 203 recipients received these PFDs, most being sent to NHS trusts (31\%), clinical commissioning groups (10\%), and general practices (10\%), of which only 58\% responded to the coroner.
Conclusions: Concerns raised by coroners in suicide-related PFDs involving medicines highlight essential gaps in care that require actions from the Government, health services, and prescribers. To aid suicide prevention, PFDs should be disseminated nationally, and responses should be enforced so that actions are taken to prevent suicides.},

    abstract = {Patient harm due to unsafe healthcare is widespread, potentially devastating, and often preventable. Hoping to eliminate avoidable harms, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Global Patient Safety Action Plan in July 2021. The UK's National Health Service relies on several measures, including ‘never events’, ‘serious incidents’, ‘patient safety events’ and coroners’ Prevention of Future Deaths reports (PFDs) to monitor healthcare quality and safety. We conducted a systematic narrative review of PubMed and medRxiv on 19 February 2023 to explore the strengths and limitations of coroners’ PFDs and whether they could be a safety tool to help meet the WHO's Global Patient Safety Action Plan. We identified 17 studies that investigated a range of PFDs, including preventable deaths involving medicines and an assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that PFDs offered important information that could support hospitals to improve patient safety and prevent deaths. However, inconsistent reporting, low response rates to PFDs, and difficulty in accessing, analysing and monitoring PFDs limited their use and adoption as a patient safety tool for hospitals. To fulfil the potential of PFDs, a national system is required that develops guidelines, sanctions failed responses and embeds technology to encourage the prevention of future deaths.},

    abstract = {Opioid deaths have increased in England and Wales. Coroners’ Prevention of Future Deaths reports (PFDs) provide important insights that may enable safer use and avert harms, yet reports implicating opioids have not been synthesized. We aimed to identify opioid-related PFDs and explore coroners’ concerns to prevent future deaths.In this systematic case series, we screened 3897 coronial PFDs dated between 01 July 2013 and 23 February 2022, obtained by web scraping the UK’s Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website. PFDs were included when an opioid was implicated in the death. Included PFDs were descriptively analysed, and content analysis was used to assess concerns reported by coroners.Opioids were involved in 219 deaths reported in PFDs (5·6\% of PFDs), equating to 4418 years of life lost (median 33 years/person). Morphine (29\%), methadone (23\%) and diamorphine (16\%) were the most common implicated opioids. Coroners most frequently raised concerns regarding systems and protocols (52\%) or safety issues (15\%). These concerns were most often addressed to National Health Service (NHS) organizations (51\%), but response rates were low overall (47\%).Opioids could be used more safely if coroners’ concerns in PFDs were addressed by national organizations such as NHS bodies, government agencies and policymakers, as well as individual prescribing clinicians.},
