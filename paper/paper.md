# Summary


Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports are how coroners in England and Wales alert others to 
circumstances that may lead to further deaths. Each report sets out the context of
an individual case, factors contributing to their death, and concerns that, if addressed, 
could prevent similar tragedies from taking place.

While these documents represent a rare, ground-level view into public safety risks, research
involving PFD reports has been notoriously challenging. Assembling a usable dataset requires 
extensive manual effort: downloading, screening, and extracting information from thousands of 
inconsistently formatted documents. This has placed effective analysis out of reach for many.

*PFD Toolkit* is a Python package designed to overcome these barriers. It automates the 
end-to-end workflow of loading, screening, and analysing PFD data. Using large language models 
(LLMs) and Vision-LLMs (supporting both proprietary and open source models), it extracts 
structured information from text and scanned reports. Users can perform natural language 
searches of reports, discover recurring themes, and extract features at scale for rapid analysis.



# Statement of need

Despite repeated calls for reform, PFD reports remain persistently underused in research 
and policy. Governmental and Parliamentary assessments have identified the current system as 
"under-utilised" for public safety, with no existing mechanisms to track recurring issues
[@home_office_hillsborough_2023; @HCJustice2021_CoronerService]. Families of the deceased have 
called PFD reports "nothing more than a paper exercise," highlighting how known risks may recur 
without scrutiny [@IAPDC_2023_pfdimpact].

This underuse is largely driven by a series of practical and technical barriers on the 
[Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website](https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/), 
where PFD reports are published: users cannot mass-download reports, formats are inconsistent, 
metadata is incomplete, and many reports are low-resolution scans that lack embedded text. 
Around 73% of reports lack thematic labels, and those that exist are inconsistently applied [@zhang_lessons_2023; @anthony_preventable_2023].

Researchers must screen and extract information from potentially thousands of reports individually, 
an effort that may require months or even years of manual labour [@bremner_systematic_2023]. 
One review on opioid deaths manually screened as many as 3897 reports by hand [@dernie_preventable_2023].

The [*Preventable Deaths Tracker*](https://preventabledeathstracker.net/) is an existing resource 
that provides valuable summary statistics and metadata on PFD reports, offering the only centralised resource of its 
kind. However, it lacks report-text searching, thematic discovery, and custom information extraction. 
There remains a critical gap in the infrastructure for supporting scalable analysis and reducing the manual burden associated with PFD research.

Researchers have called for technology to automate data collection, enhance data quality, and 
surface information from unstructured text [@bremner_systematic_2023; @zhang_lessons_2023].

*PFD Toolkit* addresses each of these longstanding challenges by enabling researchers to load and 
clean both text and image-based data; automate thematic discovery; and extract 
structured information at scale. This makes possible – for the first time – timely, comprehensive, 
and flexible analysis across the entire national archive of PFD reports.


# Key Features


1. **Rapid data access.** Instantly loads the latest Prevention of Future Deaths data, 
updated weekly.
2. **Three-layer scraping.** Handles HTML, .pdf, and scanned image reports using 
vision-enabled large language models (V-LLMs) for comprehensive data extraction.
3. **Automated text cleaning.** Corrects spelling, grammar, and formatting issues across 
diverse report structures.
4. **Flexible searching.** Allows users to automatically screen and filter thousands of 
reports using natural language queries.
5. **Topic modelling.** Discovers recurring themes contained within a given selection of 
PFD reports.
6. **Custom feature extraction.** Pulls structured fields and variables from unstructured 
report text.
7. **Parallel processing.** Supports parallel processing of both CPU and LLM tasks.


# Example usage

The example below showcases key features #1 and #4. With just a few lines of code and
minutes-long runtime, users can automate what would otherwise take months of manual 
effort: downloading and screening thousands of reports into a research-ready dataset.


```python
from pfd_toolkit import load_reports, LLM, Screener

# -- Load reports into a pandas DataFrame --
reports = load_reports(
  start_date="2013-01-01", end_date="2025-07-01")

# -- Set up an LLM client --
llm_client = LLM(api_key=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>)

# -- Screen/filter reports by a natural language query --
query="""
Reports **explicitly** mentioning detention 
under the Mental Health Act
"""

screener = Screener(reports=reports, llm=llm_client)

filtered_df = screener.screen_reports(
                          user_query=query)
```


# Availability and documentation

*PFD Toolkit* is available on PyPI (via `pip install pfd_toolkit`). Full source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sam-Osian/PFD-toolkit) while package documentation is available [here](https://sam-osian.github.io/PFD-toolkit/).

We welcome community contributions, feedback and feature requests. Please see our [contributions page](https://sam-osian.github.io/PFD-toolkit/contribute/) for more.
